# Machine Learning Project
 Course Project for CSE 5160 Machine Learning
 This was my first attempt at writing a K-NN classifier and one of my first projects within python.
 The classifier was implemented manually with minimal modules used.
 The classifier has limited accuracy due to K - NN not being the ideal classifier for this type of data.
